Our project would not have been possible without the help of several people. Here, we would like to take the time to recognise and thank everyone who helped us on our journey this year! 

## Project Development

The 2018 iGEM project E. Co-light was a team effort and would not be possible without hours of research done to make this project a reality, from those who were involved in the project development phase, to those who contributed as the year progressed. 

Special thanks to Jyler Menard for finding many of the papers regarding MetE as a control mechanism for cell growth.

The original idea for optogenetically controlled co-cultures was developed by Cody Receno as part of the BIOL 349 (Synthetic Biology Project Design) course, co-taught by Trevor Charles and Brian Ingalls.

## Interlab 
We would like to extend our most sincere gratitude to Professor Raymond Legge (Dept. of Chemical Engineering, University of Waterloo) and Andrew Assatory, a graduate student working under Professor Legge. These results would not have been possible without their assistance. Professor Legge kindly allowed us to use his BioTek Synergy 4 plate reader on very short notice, and Andrew accommodated our use of the plate reader into his busy schedule. In addition, Professor Josh Neufeld (Dept. of Biology, University of Waterloo)aided in providing a plate reader to attempt to perform the Interlab protocol. 

## Administrative Help

Lucy Satora - Provided help with administrative and shipment for the team

Jen Lehman - Provided help with finances, accessing funds, and booking of hotels for the Waterloo iGEM team.

## Co-op Student

Nicole Lassel was a co-op student in the Waterloo iGEM lab this summer. She dedicated herself to the team.  

## Conferences

Thank you to Western Universityâ€™s Bogumil Karas for allowing member of the Waterloo iGEM team to speak about iGEM and our project at the Western Syn Bio Symposium 3.0

## Wiki and Logo Development

The wiki was only possible due to the large amount of work that Nicki Shaw and Michael Astwood had put in throughout the year.

## Hardware Support

We would like to give thanks to Mark Soric, Brian Ingalls, and Matt Scott for allowing us to use the wonderful turbidostat. We would also like to thank Brian Ingalls and Matt Scott for allowing us to use their flow cytometer. Finally, we would like to thank Bruce Reed for lending us a blue LED capable of exciting GFP and several light filters.

## General Support

Thank you to Nathan Branff for providing us with support and knowledge regarding optogenetics and mathematical models.
